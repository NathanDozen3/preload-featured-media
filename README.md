# Preload Featured Media

Preload Featured Media is a WordPress plugin that automatically injects a `<link rel="preload">` element into the `<head>` of the DOMDocument. The purpose of adding a preloading link in the header is to decrease page speed load and increase Google PageSpeed Insights performance score. This plugin is useful if a theme uses featured images to display a banner image, does not preload those images, and PageSpeed Insights recommends preloading critical assets.
